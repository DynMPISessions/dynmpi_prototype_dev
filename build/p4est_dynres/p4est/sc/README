## Building `libsc`

The build instructions for `p4est` also apply to standalone builds of `libsc`.

### Autotools

The autotools build chain is fully supported.

In a fresh checkout, you may run `./bootstrap` to create the `configure`
script.  Calling `make` will regenerate the tools configuration as needed.
Only in rare cases `./bootstrap` will have to be run again.  The script depends
on existing `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool` and `pkg-config` tools.

Calling `bootstrap` is *not* required for unpacked `tar` archives, or after
pulling fresh code.

We recommend running `configure` with a relative path from an empty build
directory.  Try

    configure --help

for options and switches.  For development with MPI:

    cd empty/build/directory
    ../relative/path/to/configure --enable-mpi --enable-debug \
        CFLAGS="-O0 -g -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter"
    make -j8 V=0

To run tests in parallel, run

    make -j2 check V=0

and to pack a distribution tarball, call `bootstrap` and

    mkdir -p build && cd build && ../configure
    make -j3 distcheck V=0

The `V=0` environment variable significantly unclutters console output.
So far, we have not made `V=0` the default.
